# Hey, I'm Joon 👋

I'm a data scientist and engineer who's spent the last several years at **Meta**, **LinkedIn**, and **Google** — mostly figuring out how to make AI systems and AI native products actually useful (and not just demo-worthy).

These days I'm deep into LLM post-training, evaluation, and building agentic systems. I also like shipping real products end-to-end, which means I spend more time in TypeScript than I'd like to admit.

### Things I think about a lot

- How to evaluate LLMs beyond vibes (benchmarking, red teaming, quality metrics)
- Post-training — RLHF, DPO, fine-tuning, and why the details matter more than the method
- Agentic workflows that actually complete tasks instead of getting stuck in loops
- Experiment design and causal inference (the unglamorous backbone of good data science)
- Going from "cool prototype" to "thing people use every day"

### Projects

| Project | What it is |
|---------|------------|
| [**RideFlow**](https://ridehelp.top) | A family ride coordination app I built with AI scheduling, an @AI chat assistant, real-time tracking, and ~40 screens. React Native + Expo + TypeScript + Express. Way more complex than I originally planned. |

> More coming — working on agentic tools, Claude/Manus skills, and some analysis projects I want to write up properly.

### Tools I reach for

**AI/ML** — Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, vLLM, LangChain, Weights & Biases

**Data** — SQL, Pandas, Spark, dbt, Jupyter

**Building things** — TypeScript, React, React Native, Node.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, GCP, AWS

### What I'm up to now

- 🔨 Building agentic products and seeing what breaks
- 📝 Writing about LLM eval and post-training (slowly)
- 🧪 Making Claude/Manus skills and exploring what agents can actually do well
- 📊 Open-sourcing some data science and analysis work

<sub>I like building things that work. Sometimes they even work on the first try.</sub>
